## About
This is an informational website project for a Software Engineering IV course, to practice team collaboration and AWS deployment.  The focus of the website is on majoring in computer science at a university, with helpful information about what to expect, reasons to choose a CS major, and potential career opportunities to look forward to.

The website was made from scratch with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with no external libraries.
